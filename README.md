# stm32-blit32
decoupling firmware from 32blit engine
Decoupling the firmware would open up SDL1/2 porting, which means more software ported to 32blit.


This is just a quick test to see if I can decouple the firmware from the 32blit engine

Copy and paste the 32blit-stm32 folder and paste, copy my Src and Inc file into them and my makefile.
It compiles, but doesn't link
